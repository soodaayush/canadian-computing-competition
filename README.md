## Inspiration

I heard about this contest and decided I wanted to test my problem solving skills.

## Challenges

Designing solutions to solve the complex problems.

## The Repository

These are some of my solutions to junior CCC (Canadian Computing Competition) contests ranging from 2024 - 2010.

## Lessons Learned

I learned to break down complex problems into smaller pieces and to tackle all of the small pieces to solve the bigger problem.
