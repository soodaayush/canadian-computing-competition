## Inspiration

I heard about this programming contest and decided I wanted to test my problem-solving skills so I can eventually compete at the national or even international level.

## Challenges

Designing clean and efficient solutions to solve complex problems.

## The Repository

These are some of my solutions to Junior CCC contests ranging from 2010 - 2024.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts and address each one to solve the overall issue.

## Contests Written
