# Canadian Computing Competition

## Inspiration

I came across the CCC while looking for ways to challenge myself beyond classroom assignments. Competitive programming seemed like a natural next step, a way to sharpen both speed and precision in problem-solving. My long-term goal is to compete at the national level and, ideally, aim for the international stage.

## Challenges

Solving CCC problems isn’t just about writing code that works, it’s about writing clean, efficient, and scalable solutions. Whether it's handling edge cases, optimizing time complexity, or choosing the right data structure, every question pushes me to think critically under time constraints.

## The Repository

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC), a programming contest that tests algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, and coding under pressure. This repository is a work in progress, as I continue competing, I'll keep updating it with new insights and solutions.

## Lessons Learned

Through these contests, I've strengthened my ability to:

- Break down complex problems into manageable components
- Translate logic into clean, working code
- Analyze and improve time/space efficiency
- Reflect on mistakes and refine my approach
